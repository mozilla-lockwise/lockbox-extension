# Tests for Mozilla's Lockbox WebExtension

Thank you for checking out Mozilla's Lockbox WebExtension!

Note: These tests are written in python and use pytest as the runner.

## How to run the tests locally

### Clone the repository

If you have cloned this project already then you can skip this, otherwise you'll
need to clone this repo using Git. If you do not know how to clone a GitHub
repository, check out this [help page][git-clone] from GitHub.

If you think you would like to contribute to the tests by writing or maintaining
them in the future, it would be a good idea to create a fork of this repository
first, and then clone that. GitHub also has great instructions for
[forking a repository][git-fork].

### Build the WebExtension

The tests expect the WebExtension to be built. If not you will receive an error
stating that the addon or webextension is not found.

```sh
npm install
npm run package
```

### Run the tests

The tests must be run in Firefox 57 or later.

1. Install [Tox].
2. Download geckodriver [v0.21.0][geckodriver] or later and ensure it's
   executable and in your path.

```sh
tox
```

This will run the integration tests as well as [flake8][flake8].

If you receive errors about "No module..." then run tox with the recreate flag:

```sh
tox -r
```

## Changing or adding element selectors

[Selenium] allows for multiple types of HTML/CSS selection methods. The
documentation found [here][selenium-api] shows the different ways to use these
available methods.

The pytest plugin that we use for running tests has a number of advanced command
line options available. To see the options available, run `pytest --help`. The
full documentation for the plugin can be found [here][pytest-selenium].
