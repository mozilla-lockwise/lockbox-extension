## 0.1.4-alpha

_Date: 2017-12-11_

- Secure your Lockbox with a Firefox Account ([#362](https://github.com/mozilla-lockbox/lockbox-extension/pull/362))

### What's Fixed

### Known Issues

* **Any existing Lockbox entries from previous versions have been removed.** Previous versions were storing and encrypting data differently than we are now.s In order to add our new security features your old data can no longer be read/accessed and you'll see an empty state after you upgrade.
* Once you link a Firefox Account to Lockbox, signing in with a different account can render Lockbox unusable until you quit and restart Firefox.
* Once you link a Firefox Account to Lockbox, resetting your Firefox Account password through "forgot your password" will render all your logins inaccessible; the only recourse is to reset Lockbox and start over.
* Firefox's default prompt to save logins is only disabled on new installs of this extension; updating Lockbox will not change your current Firefox preferences.

## 0.1.3-alpha

_Date: 2017-11-29_

### What's New

* We added placeholder text into the item editor to help show what's expected  ([#336](https://github.com/mozilla-lockbox/lockbox-extension/pull/336))
* Every time the "Copy" button is used we'll log a Telemetry event ([#342](https://github.com/mozilla-lockbox/lockbox-extension/pull/342))

### What's Fixed

* Our friendly monster looks a bit better on light backgrounds ([#347](https://github.com/mozilla-lockbox/lockbox-extension/pull/347))

### Known Issues
