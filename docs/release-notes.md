# Lockbox Release Notes

## 0.1.1-alpha1

_Date: 2017-11-01_

### What's Fixed

* We added language to the first-run experience to remind testers that this is pre-release software and both **subject to change and data may not be retained**.

### Known Issues

* There is no way to change your Lockbox master password.  If you forget your master password, you'll need to start over fresh by either:
  - Opening the this extension's Preferences and clicking the "`ðŸ’¥ðŸ’£ Reset ðŸ’£ðŸ’¥`" button; or
  - Uninstalling and re-installing the extension
* Firefox's default prompt to save logins is only disabled on new installs of this extension; updating Lockbox will not change your current Firefox preferences.

## 0.1.1-alpha

_Date: 2017-10-30_

### What's New

* When installing this extension, Firefox will no longer prompt to save logins. Any logins saved in Firefox are still there, and you can still use it to autofill login forms, but the browser will not prompt to save new ones. This feature will be re-enabled if you uninstall Lockbox, and can be manually changed by the user in Firefox's preferences.([#211](https://github.com/mozilla-lockbox/lockbox-extension/issues/211))
* You now have the ability to reset Lockbox and start from scratch.([#137](https://github.com/mozilla-lockbox/lockbox-extension/issues/137))
* Front-end validation of fields in the editor ([#207](https://github.com/mozilla-lockbox/lockbox-extension/issues/207))
* New Alpha installations can now happen from [this page](https://mozilla-lockbox.github.io/lockbox-extension/) versus the email distribution of the link which results in a blank page after install.

### What's Fixed

* Improved localization including page titles ([#225](https://github.com/mozilla-lockbox/lockbox-extension/issues/225)) and default locale consistency ([#140](https://github.com/mozilla-lockbox/lockbox-extension/issues/140))
* Show/Hide password field no longer resizes the window ([#179](https://github.com/mozilla-lockbox/lockbox-extension/issues/179))
* Modal dialogs behave more consistently and even keeps entered text if the modal closes ([#162](https://github.com/mozilla-lockbox/lockbox-extension/issues/162))

### Known Issues

* There is no way to change your Lockbox master password.  If you forget your master password, you'll need to start over fresh by either:
  - Opening the this extension's Preferences and clicking the "`ðŸ’¥ðŸ’£ Reset ðŸ’£ðŸ’¥`" button; or
  - Uninstalling and re-installing the extension
