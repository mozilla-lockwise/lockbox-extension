## 0.1.9-alpha

_Date: 2018-03-22_

### What's New

- The doorhanger now presents "quick copy" buttons when there are one or two results to help you log in to websites faster ([#624](https://github.com/mozilla-lockbox/lockbox-extension/pull/624))
- Size, spacing and hover style improvements to the doorhanger entry list ([#619](https://github.com/mozilla-lockbox/lockbox-extension/pull/619))
- Improved visibility of buttons against background colors ([#657](https://github.com/mozilla-lockbox/lockbox-extension/pull/657))

### What's Fixed

- The doorhanger is a consistent height in all cases (log in, view entry list) ([#655](https://github.com/mozilla-lockbox/lockbox-extension/pull/655))
- You won't see the "clear" button (the grey "X") on the search filter until you actually start searching and need to clear something ([#680](https://github.com/mozilla-lockbox/lockbox-extension/pull/680))
