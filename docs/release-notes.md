# Lockbox Release Notes

## 0.1.0 - alpha

_Date: 2017-10-16_

### What's New

This is a pre-release of the Lockbox password manager for internal Mozilla employees.

This starts as a signed Firefox extension where you can:

* Create a Lockbox account with a master password to lock/unlock your data
* View entries
* Search entries
* Add, edit, and delete entries
* Copy username and password to clipboard
* Submit feedback

### Known Issues

* There is no way to reset your Lockbox master password. If you forget your master password, you'll need to create a new profile and start fresh.
* This is a Lockbox account, which stays local to your Firefox installation. There is no integration with Firefox accounts to sync (yet).
