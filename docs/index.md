The Lockbox extension is a simple, stand-alone password manager that works
with Firefox for desktop. It’s the first of several planned experiments
designed to help us test and improve password management and online
security.

Install it and sign in with your Firefox Account to encrypt your data with
tamper-resistant block cipher technology. Then [share feedback
