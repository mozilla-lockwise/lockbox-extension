The Lockbox extension is a simple, stand-alone password manager that works
with Firefox for desktop. It’s the first of several planned experiments
designed to help us test and improve password management and online
security.

**Lockbox is an experimental prototype and is not currently or actively planning to fix non-critical (data loss, security related) bugs or implement new features.**

Install it and sign in with your Firefox Account to encrypt your data with
tamper-resistant block cipher technology. Then [share feedback
