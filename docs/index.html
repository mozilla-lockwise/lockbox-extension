  <p>The Lockbox extension is a simple, stand-alone password manager that works
  with Firefox for desktop. It’s the first of several planned experiments
  designed to help us test and improve password management and online
  security.</p>

  <p>Install it and sign in with your Firefox Account to take full advantage of
  cloud backup and next-generation encryption. Then
