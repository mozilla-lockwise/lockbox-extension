# Lockbox for Firefox

Lockbox for Firefox is a work-in-progress extension for Firefox to improve upon
Firefox's built-in password management. If you're interested, you should
probably come back later when we have more to show!

## Installing

To **build the project** and install dependencies, simply run:

```sh
npm install
```

## Building

To **build the project**, simply run:

```sh
npm run-script build
```

This puts all the necessary files in the `dist/` directory, which you can then
load into Firefox (e.g. `about:debugging`).

If you'd like to **build an extension .xpi**, you can run:

```sh
npm run-script package
```

The resulting add-on is unsigned and likely won't work on release versions of
Firefox. You can flip the `xpinstall.signatures.required` preference on other
channels accordingly.

In preparation for 57, legacy extensions are also disabled. So you'll need to flip the `extensions.legacy.enabled` preference, too.

## Quick Start

If you'd like to quickly **start up a new Firefox profile** with Lockbox
installed for development/testing, you can run:

```sh
npm run-script run
```

To include additional flags for a specific run, append them after `--`:

```sh
npm run-script run -- -b nightly
```

To specify flags to use regularly, use `npm config set jpm_runflags`:

```sh
npm config set jpm_runflags="-b nightly"
```
