# Lockbox for Firefox

Lockbox for Firefox is a work-in-progress extension for Firefox to improve upon
Firefox's built-in password management. If you're interested, you should
probably come back later when we have more to show!

## Building

If you'd like to build the .xpi from the latest master, simply run the
following:

```sh
$ make package
```

Note of course that the resulting add-on is unsigned, and likely won't work on
release versions of Firefox.

## License

This add-on is [licensed][license-link] under the Mozilla Public License,
version 2.0.

## For Development

*WARNING* This voids your warranty!

*NOTE*  Firefox caches Javascript even from extensions.  To mitigate this, specify `-purgecaches` when launching Firefox to ensure extension JavaScript files are refreshed.
